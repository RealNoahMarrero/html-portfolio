<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Noah Marrero, an enthusiastic web developer with a focus on front-end development, though 
  I'm always open to exploring new areas within the field. I'm excited about the possibilities of web development 
  and eager to learn and grow my skills.</p>

<p>I bring a keen eye for detail and a knack for problem-solving to my work, which I believe are essential qualities 
  for creating user-friendly and functional websites.</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is to transition into a full-time web development role, ideally working remotely for a startup 
  or any company that recognizes my potential. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and am excited to see where this 
  journey takes me.</p>

<p>While I'm new to web development, I bring a diverse range of experiences and interests to the table. I'm 
  100% Puerto Rican, a basketball player, a YouTuber, and I also work at a nursing facility. I'm passionate about 
  cooking, fitness, and exploring new challenges. I believe my versatility and willingness to learn will make me a 
  valuable asset to any team.</p>

<p>I'm ready to give my all to mastering web development and building a successful career in this field.</p>
